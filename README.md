# Formula Random
The question this project poses is, "what if the result of every Formula 1 race was random?"
(i.e., no dominant, top and midfield teams, all cars/drivers equal)

Obviously this isn't realistic, but that's not the point, which is just to see what
an F1 championship could look like if there was nothing in the way of any driver or
team winning a race and/or championship.

Race/championship-influencing factors that are left out for now: sprint races,
shortened races due to bad weather, DNFs, reserve drivers, etc.

This is a console-based program for now, but I intend to turn it into a web app.
